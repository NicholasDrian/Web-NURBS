## What is it?

Web NURBS is 3D modeling software designed to run in your browser. It uses WebGPU (the successor to WebGL) for a modern and performant GPU workflow. The program is written in about 12k lines of TypeScript and WGSL. 

Web NURBS has a CLI inspired by Rhino, Modal editing inspired by Vim, and a Scene Object Model inspired by the Document Object Model.

Web NURBS is far from complete, and lacking much documentation. That being said it is working well and ready for use!

## Whats to come?

I am currently moving surface sampling to compute shaders and expect significant performance gains (100x give or take). Next, I will move the acceleration structures (Bounding Volume Heirarchies) to the GPU. The goal is to move any serious compute away from JavaScript inorder to acheve buttery smooth rendering. 

I also need to get alpha blending up and running... So stay tuned for transparency, GPU acceleration, and various other improvements!
