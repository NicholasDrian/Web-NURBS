## What is it?
Web NURBS is 3D NURBS modeling software designed to run in your browser. It uses WebGPU, a modern repladement for WebGL. The program is written in about 12k lines of TypeScript and Web Graphics Shader Language. 

Web NURBS has a CLI inspired by Rhino, Modal editing inspired by Vim, and a reactive Scene Object Model inspired by the Document Object Model.

Web NURBS is far from complete, and lacking documentation. That being said it is working and ready for use!
