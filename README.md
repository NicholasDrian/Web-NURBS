## What is it?

Web NURBS is light weight 3D modeling software designed to run in your browser. It uses WebGPU (the successor to WebGL) for a modern and performant GPU workflow. The program is written in about 15k lines of TypeScript and WGSL. 

Web NURBS has a CLI inspired by Rhino, Modal editing inspired by Vim, and a Scene Object Model inspired by the DOM.

Web NURBS is far from complete, and lacking much documentation. That being said it is working well and ready for use!

## Whats to come?

I'm currently working on another project (https://github.com/NicholasDrian/web_cad) that is the accelerated version of this repo. The project moves all heavy compute to the GPU and keeps all explicit geometry exclusively on the GPU for blazing low latency. So far this project supports surface sampling and acceleration structure generation on the GPU, but much has to be added before it is ready for the public eye. 

I also need to get alpha blending up and running... So stay tuned for transparency, GPU acceleration, and various other improvements!
